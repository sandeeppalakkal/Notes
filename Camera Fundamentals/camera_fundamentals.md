Camera Fundamentals

# Focal Length

* Parallel rays converge to a point at focal length behind the camera
* Objects at infinity converges to a point at focal length behind the camera
* Rays from a point closer to the lens converges to a point behind focal length (more distance from camera)
* To keep the same object in focus, move the sensor further back
* Field of view, FOV = 2 x arctan(h/2f), where h is the sensor size and f is the focal length
* Larger the focal length, lesser the FOV, larger the zoom
* Fish eye camera, f = 8-10mm or 15-16mm
* Ultra-wide angle lens, f = 24mm (for 35mm film format)
* Wide-angle lens, f = 24 to 35mm
* Normal lens, f = 36 to 60 mm (in 35mm film format)
* Telephoto lens, f = 85 to 135mm (short), 135 to 300 (medium) or >300 (super telephoto)
* 35mm film: 36x24 mm (3:2) film format

# Focal Distance

* Distance between lens and the plane of focus in scene
* Only a plane will be truly in focus with a lens
* With pin-hole camera, entire scene will be in focus, but dark
* In camera with lens, change of focus occurs by moving lens or sensor

# Shutter Speed and Exposure Time

* Rule of thumb for longest exposure = 1/focal length

# Irradiance

* Total amount of light falling on a unit area of sensor per second
* Controlled by aperture

# Exposure

* Exposure = Irradiance x Exposure Time

# Aperture

* Irradiance on a sensor is proportional to (1) square of aperture diameter (A) and (2) inverse square of lens-to-sensor distance (~focal length)
* Aperture number, N = f/A
* Aperture number indicates irradiance irrespective of focal length (larger the N, smaller the irradiance)
* Aperture number is usually denoted as f/N (e.g., f/2.0 indicates N = 2.0)
* E.g.: Doubling N reduces A by 2x ==> Irradiance reduces by 4x. So, going from f/2.0 to f/4.0 cuts down light by 4x
* Main side-effect of aperture is depth of field. Doubling N doubles depth of field.
